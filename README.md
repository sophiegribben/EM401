# Domestic Load Profile Synthesis for LV network simulation at scale
A repositry to store code from my dissertation project

## Files


### lcl shape syth
Using low carbon london and guassian methods to synthesise load profiles
 * guassian_model builds 1 year worth of profiles
 * extract_profile1 splits up the ELEXON profile class 1 for plotting purposes
 * plotting_script generates graphs for my final report


### REFIT 
Using the REFIT household load profiles to build profiles based on appliance start times
 * REFIT_profile extracts the start times of appliances


### python learning
 * for misc. scripts used to familiarise myself with python

## Other Documents
All documents related to the project are stored on my University OneDrive.
